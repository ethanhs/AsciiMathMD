# AsciiMathMD
This is a tool I hacked together to use instead of having to write latex.

# Installation and usage:
First, install a Python 3 version. I have been testing on Python 3.7.4 x64. Then I installed PySide2 from pypi by running `pip3 install PySide2`

Then I install misaka (the markdown renderer for this program) via `pip3 install misaka`. 

Then you can clone this repo, and from it run `python -m AsciiMathMD`, and the program should run.

Alternatively, you can permanently install it via `pip3 install .`
