# AsciiMathMD
Don't use this yet, it is just a tool I hacked together for my own uses, but I thought people might be interested in it as an idea.

#installation and usage:
First, install a Python 3 version. I have been testing on Python 3.5.1 x86. Then I installed PyQt5 from pypi by running `pip install PyQt5`

Then I install misaka (the markdown renderer for this program) via `pip install misaka`. 

Then you can clone this repo, and from it run `python -m AsciiMathMD`, and the program should run.
